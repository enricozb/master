== INSTALL ==
 1.) All Platforms


== All ==

 * Link the curl library to the project with g++ : -lcurl
 * add the headers or link directly to the precompiled Browser library
 * compile
 * don't forget that if you create an installer and you dynamically linked to curl (or Browser) you must assure that the end-users have the curl library already. Otherwise do a static link.
